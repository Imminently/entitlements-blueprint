# Contributing to Entitlements Blueprint

👋 Thanks for checking out this project. 

This isn’t your typical open-source repo — we’re not looking for pull requests (yet).  

This is an **invitation to start a conversation**.

## 💡 Why This Exists

We built this repo to share how we approached one of the most complex challenges in government tech:  
**Modernising welfare systems by starting with the rules, not the code.**

The project you see here is real — delivered for a national agency in just 8 weeks with:
- 100% accuracy vs a legacy mainframe
- Full audit trails
- Rules written in natural language
- Real transparency for policy and engineering teams alike

If you're tackling similar problems — legacy logic, entitlements, COBOL codebases, or opaque systems —  
we’d love to talk.

## 🤝 How to Engage

- Want a walkthrough of how this works?
- Curious how your own policy model could be digitised?
- Already knee-deep in AI-translated legacy code and wondering how to validate it?

📬 **Email us** at [info@imminently.co](mailto:info@imminently.co) (we're timezone-friendly)

We’re happy to:
- Review your problem space
- Show you a live demo of Decisively
- Explore how this architecture could apply to your domain

## 🚧 Looking to Collaborate?

We’re open to:
- Co-designing modernisation approaches
- Running pilot projects with policy + engineering teams
- Partnering with delivery teams already working in the entitlements space

Let’s build better government systems — ones we can actually explain.
