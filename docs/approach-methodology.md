# Background & Project Summary

## 🎯 The Challenge

Governments around the world rely on decades-old systems to calculate and administer welfare payments. In one such national system, a legacy mainframe has long been responsible for determining entitlements under a large and complex welfare framework — including age-based income support.

These systems are:
- ❌ Difficult to understand
- ❌ Expensive to maintain
- ❌ Slow to update when policy changes
- ❌ Opaque to both administrators and the public

Modernising these systems is often approached as a massive code rewrite. But this can recreate the same complexity and errors in a newer language. The problem isn't just the *technology* — it's how the underlying logic is captured, maintained, and explained.

## 💡 Our Hypothesis

Instead of modernising the code, start by modernising the *decisions*.

We proposed a **top-down approach** to system reform:

> Legislation → Digitised Rules → Executable Logic → Explainable Decisions

This flips the traditional bottom-up rewrite by focusing on:
- What the law and policy actually say
- How those rules interconnect over time
- Building a source of truth that is both machine-executable and human-readable

The result? A decision engine that is accurate by design, faster to update, and fully transparent.

## 🔧 What We Did

Working within a government environment responsible for national income support, we used our platform **Decisively** to digitise the rules governing the aged pension.

In just **8 weeks**, we:

- Ingested legislation, operational manuals, and calculation rules
- Converted them into a structured rule graph with traceable logic paths
- Aligned this logic with test data and existing system outputs
- Ran in **side-by-side comparison mode** with the mainframe
- Delivered **100% accuracy** in entitlement decisions — with full audit trails

And we didn’t need to look at a single line of COBOL.

## 🧪 Why It Worked

- **Top-Down Logic**: Starting from legislation avoids embedding past mistakes.
- **Declarative Rule Graph**: Encodes the logic as a connected, inspectable structure.
- **Human-Centred Design**: Rules are written in plain language, editable by domain experts.
- **Automated Audit Trails**: Every decision includes a report showing what was calculated, why, and how it aligns with the law.

## 📊 Results

| Metric                         | Outcome                             |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Project Duration              | 8 weeks                              |
| Pages Digitised               | 2,000+ (Aged Pension framework)      |
| Accuracy vs Legacy System     | 100% (on matched scenarios)          |
| Decision Speed                | <500ms per calculation               |
| Transparency                  | Full audit trail, linked to source   |
| Rule Reusability              | ~80% reused in adjacent programs     |

This wasn’t just a better engine — it was a better understanding of the entitlement logic itself.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Rebuilding social support systems is about more than better interfaces or faster code. It’s about **restoring trust in public decision-making**.

This approach shows that:
- You can digitise entitlement logic rapidly, at scale
- You can surface inconsistencies and fix them
- You can deliver fast, fair, explainable outcomes

If you're facing the challenge of modernising entitlements or social support systems, this blueprint offers a different path.
