## ❓ FAQ: You Might Be Wondering...

### 🧾 Can I use this for my own legislation?

Absolutely — that's the whole point.

Every implementation is different. We don't shoehorn you into *our* model — we help you build *your* model from the legislation itself. That means:
- Your data structure is shaped by the law
- Your rules reflect actual policy intent
- And your SMEs can actually read them

No weird translation layer. No “proprietary logic translator”. Just natural language → logic → decision.

### 🧪 I’ve already got test cases. Are they useful?

Yes — and they make us very happy.

Your existing test cases are gold for two reasons:
1. They help validate the rule graph (scenario testing)
2. They reveal nuance in the implementation that SMEs may not have documented

Drop them in, and we’ll light them up across our engine.

### ⚙️ Can I integrate this with my existing stack?

For sure.

We built Decisively to be **headless** and modular. You can:
- Call it via API to evaluate rules behind the scenes
- Pipe decisions directly into your CRM or portal
- Or use our UI tooling to walk users through complex flows

It can be invisible, integrated, or fully branded — up to you.

We come from an enterprise background. It shows.

### 🛰️ Can this run in a secure / air-gapped environment?

Yes — and it already does.

Government departments don’t always want their business logic floating around in the cloud. We get it.

You can:
- Run Decisively in your own cloud
- Deploy on-prem in a fully air-gapped Kubernetes cluster
- Stay completely disconnected from our infrastructure

It’s your infrastructure, your rules, your control.

### 🛠️ Is this open source?

No — but hear us out.

While the engine itself is proprietary, everything around it is transparent:
- Rules are written in natural language
- Inputs and outputs are pure JSON
- Audit trails are readable by humans (and machines)

It’s not open-source — but it’s open-format, auditable, and not a black box.

### 💥 Can this handle legislation as gnarly as ours?

If you’re working with welfare, pensions, disability, or any social entitlements — yes.

We digitised an entire national pension act — over 2,000 pages of legislation + supporting policy — in **8 weeks**. With **3 engineers** and **3 SMEs**.

Even if your system has edge cases, overrides, and time-travel logic: we’ve probably seen worse.

### 👾 What if I want to try this on my own rules?

That’s why we’re here.

📬 [Email us](mailto:info@imminently.co) and we’ll show you how it works.

You bring the rules. We’ll bring the engine.
