## ✅ What We Delivered

As part of a proof-of-concept commissioned by a major government agency, we — the team at **Imminently** — provided the **rules engine**, **platform**, and **authoring methodology** behind the scenes. The delivery was formally managed under a systems integrator (SecureFast), as noted in public documents.

In just **8 weeks**, we:

- Digitised the entire **Aged Pension Act**
- Wrote all rules in **natural language**, directly from legislation
- Delivered **100% accurate outcomes** in **shadow mode**, mirroring the mainframe
- Produced **human-readable audit reports** with full traceability
- Deployed the platform **inside the agency's own infrastructure**, fully air-gapped

All done by **3 engineers and 3 SMEs**.  
Zero COBOL. No black boxes.

## 🛑 So Why Didn’t It Go Live?

Let’s be honest: it worked.

But production rollout didn’t happen. Not because of the tech. Not because of the results.

It came down to:
- Procurement processes
- Competing programs
- Bureaucratic gravity

It’s a familiar story for anyone who’s worked in large-scale government IT.

We’re not here to throw shade — we still work closely with government teams — but it’s worth noting that a **proven**, **faster**, **cheaper**, and **more explainable** system was explored… and then paused.

## 🧭 Why It Matters

Most prototypes die quietly.

This one didn’t.

The fact that it:
- Was tabled in Parliament  
- Sparked media coverage  
- Triggered discussion about value-for-money and alternatives  
…shows that **the model itself is credible**.

And the takeaway isn’t just “we should’ve used this.”

It’s:  
> You don’t have to modernise welfare logic by translating 1970s COBOL line-by-line.

You can start from the rules, build a graph, trace every decision — and deliver outcomes you can actually explain.
